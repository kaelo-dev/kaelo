"Welcome to my digital garden, referred to as 'Tshimo' in my home language, Sesotho. In this corner of the internet, I cultivate my thoughts on Artificial Intelligence, learning, and navigating life in general. Tending to a garden requires a bit of effort but is also immensely therapeutic. I hope you and I will harvest new ideas to nourish our complex minds." - Kaelo
